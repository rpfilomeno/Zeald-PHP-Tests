# Zeald-PHP-Tests

This is a programmer job  test from Dash10.


## Question: 10 different areas where the original-code has problems:

1. Poor Database schema, should use primary keys generated.
2. No Migration (must use sql dump)
3. No Model implemetation (i have to implement the solution as well  without model due to no migration to save time, i could have use Talend ETL this to proper database schema)
4. No Tests (its so small it may be ok tho)
5. No Views/template (inlining html in return)
6. No use of QRM, hard coded credentials
7. No sanitation
8. Poor Reuse due to missing MVC/laravel framework
9. No adhering to S.O.L.I.D. principles
10. No routing, API url not friendly.
